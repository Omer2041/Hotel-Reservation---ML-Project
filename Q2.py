Question 2: How does the number of adults, children, and special requests affect the average price per room?

The question is asking to analyze the relationship between the number of adults, children, and special requests
and the average price per room.
The results from the Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree algorithms provide predictions
for the average price per room based on the number of adults, children, and special requests.
These predictions can be used to understand how changes in the number of adults,
children, and special requests affect the average price per room.

    Mean Absolute Error part:
    The mean absolute error (MAE) is a measure of how well the model is able to predict the target variable.
    The smaller the MAE, the better the model is at making predictions.
    
    For example, the MAE for the Linear Regression model is 22.93, for the Random Forest model is 21.81,
    and for the Decision Tree model is 21.81.
    
    In this case,
    the Random Forest and Decision Tree models are performing slightly better than the Linear Regression model, with lower MAE.
    It's also worth noting that the difference between the MAE of the three models is not that big.
    
    The predictions presented in ta graph:
    The graph visualizes the relationship between the predicted room prices and the actual room prices.
    From the graph, you can determine the accuracy of each prediction technique by comparing the actual room prices
    and the predicted room prices. If the actual room prices are close to the predicted room prices,
    then the prediction is accurate. However, if the actual room prices are far from the predicted room prices,
    then the prediction is not accurate.
